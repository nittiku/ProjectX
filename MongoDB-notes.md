# MongoDB Notes
## Document creation

While creating a date object in the document, the date format used is ISO 8601

### Example: 2023-05-11T00:00:00.000+00:00

- "2023-05-11" represents the year, month, and day in the format of YYYY-MM-DD

- "T00:00:00.000" represents the time in the format of HH:MM:SS.mmm, where "T" is a separator between the date and time. In this case, it indicates the time as 00:00:00.000, which means midnight.

- "+00:00" represents the time zone offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In this case, it indicates that the time zone is UTC, which is equivalent to GMT

- So, for india it would be: "+05:30"
