# What we need to consider:
1. Task management: Allow users to create and assign tasks, set due dates, and track progress. This could include features such as task categories, labels, and priority levels.

2. Time tracking: Enable users to track the time spent on each task, so they can better manage their workload and ensure that they meet project deadlines.

3. Project dashboards: Provide users with a dashboard that shows an overview of their projects, including upcoming deadlines, task status, and progress.

4. Collaboration tools: Allow users to collaborate with team members by commenting on tasks, assigning tasks to others, and sharing files.

5. Customizable workflows: Allow users to customize their workflows based on their specific needs, including adding custom fields, labels, and statuses.

6. Reporting and analytics: Provide users with reporting and analytics features that allow them to measure team productivity, identify bottlenecks, and optimize their workflows.

7. Mobile app: Develop a mobile app that allows users to manage their projects on-the-go, including receiving push notifications for task updates and tracking time.
